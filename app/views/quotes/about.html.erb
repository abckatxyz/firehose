  <h1>About</h1>

<p>
  This site was built by Kathrina Maribao, former dancer and current web developer in training. She felt that over time, she slowly drifted away from the dance scene she was once a part of and wanted to share her feelings or nostalgia about being out of the dance community.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately she does not dance anymore and can't even remember the last time she took a dance class. However, if the opportunity presents itself, she doesn't mind shaking her booty once in awhile. Few occasions that you can usually find her dancing at are  concerts and music festivals.

<p>
  Kat is on a mission to learn how to code and is doing so through Firehose Project. Eventually she wants to land a junior web developer position and hopefully code things that are either meaningful or really fun for people. She actually finds that there are many similarities between coding and dancing which is why she likes coding so much.

<p>
  A few of them are:
  <ul>
    <li> anyone can learn</li>
    <li> friendly community open to helping everyone learn </li>
    <li> both are crafts in their own right where you need the discipline to practice, practice, practice </li>
    <li> involves a mix of creating your own work and copying what others do </li>
    <li> there are many many ways to do it! </li>
  </ul>
